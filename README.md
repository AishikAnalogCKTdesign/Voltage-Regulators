# Voltage-Regulators

  
In this document we will show what are the different types of Voltage regulators and what are its basic different circuit structures.

First of all I would like to tell you that there are 3 types of voltage regulator which I am going to discuss about.First is the normal voltage regulator second is the SMPS and third is the LDO (Low dropout)

People I have seen find it difficult to understand the SMPS after they learnt the normal voltage regulators but if we see the circuit then we will see that both the circuit is 90 percent same only 3 components are added in and SMPS which is shown in Pic 1.

Lets discuss about the # NORMAL VOLTAGE REGULATOR Pic 1 fig a.

A voltage regulator has an op-Amp working in the non inverting mode and it has got a resistor divider working as a negative feedback.Now what happens is that the output voltage will try to meet the difference bewtween the inputs of a op-Amp.That is how the voltage is regulated in the circuit.The reference voltage should be applied at the non inverting end of the amplifier.

Now coming to the # SMPS or the switch mode voltage regulator as it is shown in the Pic 1 fig b.It is just that the inductor a diode and a filter capacitor is being used unlike the normal voltage regulator as shown in the Pic.Another important component which is added is the PWM or the pulse generator.So as a whole the two circuit works almost similarly with few alterations as discussed.
